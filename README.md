**!~ATH** (pronounced "until death") is an esoteric programming language where all control flow is predicated on waiting for things to die. Inspired by the fictional ~ATH language from Homestuck. Everything is about death. Loops wait for entities to die. Computation happens in death callbacks. The language is deliberately inconvenient.
